# Payment Processing System

## Overview
The **Payment Processing System** is a backend microservices-based project that enables secure payment transactions using **Golang, Gin, PostgreSQL, Kafka, and Stripe**. It follows a **scalable and modular architecture**, ensuring high availability and reliability.

## Tech Stack
- **Golang** â€“ Backend development
- **Gin** â€“ Web framework for API handling
- **PostgreSQL** â€“ Database for storing user and transaction details
- **Kafka** â€“ Event-driven messaging system
- **Stripe API** â€“ Payment processing
- **Docker** â€“ Containerization
- **Kubernetes (future)** â€“ For orchestration and deployment

## Services
1. **User Service** â€“ Handles authentication, authorization, and user management.
2. **Payment Service** â€“ Processes payments and integrates with Stripe.
3. **Transaction Service (Upcoming)** â€“ Manages transaction records and history.
4. **Notification Service (Upcoming)** â€“ Sends real-time notifications to users.

## Current Features
- âœ… **User Authentication & Authorization** (JWT-based Sign-Up & Sign-In)
- âœ… **Payment Integration with Stripe** (Initial implementation using Payment Intents)
- âœ… **Kafka Producer** (Publishes payment events)
- âœ… **Webhook for Stripe** (Processes payment updates)

## Future Implementations (In Progress)
- ðŸ”„ **Kafka Consumer** â€“ Listen to payment events and update the database.
- ðŸ”„ **Transaction Logging** â€“ Store transaction records for reconciliation.
- ðŸ”„ **Retry Mechanism** â€“ Implement **Kafka Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** for failed payments.
- ðŸ”„ **Kubernetes Deployment** â€“ Deploy services in a scalable environment.
- ðŸ”„ **Custom Payment Flow** â€“ Transition from Stripe to an in-house payment gateway.

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
- Install **Go (v1.20+)**
- Install **Docker & Docker Compose**
- Install **PostgreSQL**
- Install **Kafka** (Locally or via Docker)

### Running the Services
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Rahul13900/Payment-Processing-System.git
cd payment-processing-system

# Start PostgreSQL and Kafka (Docker recommended)
docker-compose up -d

# Run User Service
go run user-service/main.go

# Run Payment Service
go run payment-service/main.go
```

### Testing Webhooks Locally
```sh
stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:8080/webhook/stripe
```

## API Endpoints
### User Service
- `POST /signup` â€“ Register a new user
- `POST /signin` â€“ Authenticate user and return JWT

### Payment Service
- `POST /payments` â€“ Initiate a payment request
- `POST /webhook/stripe` â€“ Listen for Stripe events
